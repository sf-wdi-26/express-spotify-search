**Objective:** Use Express to make a RESTful API for a customized song list. Adapt the client for your app to use Handlebars templating to `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` tracks.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repo, and clone it into your development directory on your local machine.
2. Follow the challenges from the <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-26/modules/tree/master/w08/d03/m2-express-api" target="_blank">Express API</a> module. By the end of the challenges, **you should have:**
  * A RESTful API with server routes to Search for songs on Spotify and "CRUD" them in your own db
3. Once your API is finished, build a client for your app. **A user should be able to:**
  * See a list of all tracks
  * Create a new track
  * Update an existing track
  * Delete an existing track
4. Make sure to take advantage of Bootstrap for a good UX.

## Completion

* As you make code changes, frequently commit and push to GitHub.
